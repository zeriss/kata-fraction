-   Requirements: Recent version of node.js
-   Install Dependencies: `yarn install`
-   Run tests with file watching for fast feedback: `yarn run test -- --watch`
-   Coverage `yarn run test -- --coverage`

## Presentation

The Fraction Kata consists of writing an application that allows performing the four basic mathematical operations on fractions:

-   addition,
-   subtraction,
-   multiplication,
-   division.
    The program must provide the result in the form of an irreducible fraction and therefore simplified if necessary.

Examples of fractions :
[] 4/7 + 2/7 = 6/7
[] 4/7 - 2/7 = 2/7
[] 4/7 \* 2/7 = 8/49
[] 4/7 / 2/7 = 2

The objective is to create a Fraction class that handles common arithmetic operations on fractions, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This kata allows you to become familiar with managing rational numbers, fraction simplification algorithms, and good programming practices in TypeScript.
